* When the user enters the schema and seed commands a development database is created and seeded with the test data.
* When the user starts the server the Sequalize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* The user can use Insomnia Core to open API Get routes for categories, products, and tags and view the corresponding requested data for these routes in JSON format.
